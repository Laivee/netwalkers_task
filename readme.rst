NetwalkerTask (CodeIgniter 3)
=================================

What is NetwalkerTask?
---------------------------

**NetwalkerTask** is a very simple content management system created to prove my competence with the old **CodeIgniter 3** PHP framework. I implemented routing, form validation, file upload as well as storing validated form inputs to the database.

Features
--------------

- üóÇÔ∏è Basic creation and storage of records
- üìä Follows the proper MVC architecture 
- üìÉ Basic form validation
- üìÅ Ability to upload png and jpg/jpeg images
- üåê Friendly URLs
- üõ†Ô∏è Easily customizable
- üñ•Ô∏è Easy to install

Important Notes
---------------

Ensure ``ENVIRONMENT`` is set to ``testing`` or ``production`` in the ``index.php`` file of the root folder. This is to avoid the flagging of warnings due to outdated code in the ``system`` folder of CodeIgniter 3. 

Minimum server requirements:
  
  - PHP >= 5.6
  - MySQL >= 5.5
  - Apache/Nginx with URL rewriting (mod_rewrite) enabled

- Key configuration files:

  - ``application/config/config.php``
  - ``application/config/database.php``

Example Configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    // application/config/config.php
    $config['base_url'] = 'your_base_url_here'; //https://example.com or http://localhost/project_folder_name

    // application/config/database.php
    $db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
    $db['default']['username'] = 'your_database_username';
    $db['default']['password'] = 'your_database_password';
    $db['default']['database'] = 'your_database_name';
